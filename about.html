                    <p>I am the founder of The Ninth Wave, and I'm so happy to finally build and deliver this dream of mine.</p>

                    <p>Here's the thing: everybody out there—whether starting a business or working in one—is looking for that <em>one thing</em> that's going to set them apart. The problem is we all continue to look outside of ourselves for the solution. <strong>The reality is, we are the solution. Pretty much every time.</strong></p>

                    <p>And if <strong>YOU'RE</strong> not the solution, guess what? <strong>YOUR PEOPLE ARE.</strong></p>

                    <p>People-focused training and business strategy is what sets the long-term players apart from the "quick in, quick out" people. The magic here is that science literally backs us up: People-first training in companies with a good culture make more money.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:#ffcc00; margin-top:40px;">BACKGROUND: THE GRIT</h3>
                    <p>I've never been afraid to get my hands dirty. Whether it was navigating a male-dominated field like the automotive industry in my early 20s as a <strong>"Baby Manager"</strong> running a dispatch office of 30+ drivers, or learning to drive lifted 4x4 vehicles through the mud—I love a good adventure inside the challenge.</p>
                    
                    <p>But my authority comes from the High-Stakes world of the <strong>Oregon Cannabis Market</strong>. This wasn't just retail; it was regulated chaos.</p>

                    <ul class="cred-list" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        <li>✓ <strong>Volume:</strong> Managed $2M - $5M annual revenue footprints.</li>
                        <li>✓ <strong>Operations:</strong> Handled all purchasing, inventory, and vendor relations.</li>
                        <li>✓ <strong>HR & The Hard Stuff:</strong> I handled the hiring, the onboarding, and yes—the firing. I know how to have the difficult conversations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Top this off with making cold calls to dentist's offices, appointment setting, or handling special accounts for national brands—I am definitely not your average consultant.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:#9933ff; margin-top:30px;">THE SECRET SAUCE</h3>
                    <p>It's like taking a blend of the Yoga teacher that's in front of you at Starbucks (with all her "Woo Woo" energy) and mixing it with the Einstein in the corner, quietly observing how the universe actually flows.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Enter Quantum Physics.</strong> No, I'm not a scientist. However, I am an expert at pattern recognition and seeing between the lines where other people can't. This is the <strong>Observer Effect</strong>—the concept that simply <em>observing</em> a problem changes its outcome.</p> 
                    
                    <p>So when I mix all of these together, what you get is the secret sauce. The catalyst to your empire.</p>
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top:20px; border-left: 2px solid #ffcc00; padding-left: 15px;">
                        "The proof is in the pudding. I am both the chaos of The Ninth Wave—and the force that will get you to the other side."

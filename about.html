            <p>I didn't become "The Architect" because I wanted a career change. I became one because <span class="highlight-purple">the system crashed</span> and forced a hard restart.</p>

            <p>In <span class="highlight-green">March 2024</span>, I hit the Zero Point. You know that meme of the dog sitting in a burning room saying "This is fine"? I lived that. Except instead of sitting there, I opened the door, saw the fire, said <em>"Nope,"</em> and walked out into the void.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to a bridge in the middle of the city. I was watching the sunrise, ready to throw in the towel. But the universe intervened.</p>

            <p>It wasn't a profound moment with angels playing harps. It was a glitch. A <span class="highlight-purple">breadcrumb</span>. Just enough distraction to break the loop. Those breadcrumbs—a sunrise that shouldn't have been there, heart-shaped rocks in the dirt—led my body away from the edge when my soul was too heavy to carry itself.</p>

            <p>I realized I wasn't just "unlucky." I was being stripped. The old code—the people-pleasing, the frantic managing, the trying to be a "House" for everyone else—was deleted so I could understand my true function.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                I am not the House.<br>
                I am the Bridge.
            </div>

            <p>My purpose isn't to shelter you; it's to help you cross over. To help business owners cross from <span class="highlight-green">Chaos to Flow</span>. To help survivors cross from "Survival Mode" to <span class="highlight-purple">Sovereignty</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>The Ninth Wave</strong> is the methodology I built to survive the wipe. It combines the tactical precision of Ops Management with the reality-hacking principles of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>It is the manual for finding and becoming the home you always longed for within yourself.</p>

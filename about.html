                    <p>I am the founder of The Ninth Wave, and I'm so happy to finally build and deliver this dream of mine.</p>

                    <p>Here's the thing: everybody out there—whether starting a business or working in one—is looking for that <em>one thing</em> that's going to set them apart or put them over the edge to finally make them successful. The problem is we all continue to look outside of ourselves and to others for the solution. <strong>The fact of the matter is, we are the solution. Pretty much every time.</strong></p>

                    <p>And if you're not the solution, your people are. People-focused training and business strategy is what sets the long-term players apart from the "quick in, quick out, make your money and run" people. The magic here is that science literally backs us up. People-first training in companies with a good culture make more money.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:#9933ff; margin-top:30px;">THE SECRET SAUCE</h3>
                    <p>It's like taking a blend of the Yoga teacher that's in front of you at Starbucks in the morning—all of her "Woo Woo" energy you hear her going on about—and mixing it with the Einstein in the corner, quietly observing everybody, seeing how nature and the universe actually flows.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Enter Quantum Physics.</strong> No, I'm not a scientist. However, I am an expert at pattern recognition and seeing between the lines where other people can't. So when I mix all of these together, what you get is the secret sauce. The catalyst to your empire.</p>
                    
                    <p style="font-style:italic; color:#00cccc;">Let me show you how. I'll see you at The Ninth Wave.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:#ffcc00; margin-top:40px;">BACKGROUND: THE GRIT</h3>
                    <p>I've never been afraid to get my hands dirty. In my career or my personal life, I have almost always chosen to take the path less traveled. Whether it was starting out as a waitress, or navigating a male-dominated field like the automotive industry in my early 20s as a <strong>"Baby Manager,"</strong> or learning to drive lifted 4x4 vehicles through the mud (and still being able to get them home!)—I love a good adventure inside the challenge.</p>
                    
                    <p>Top this off with making cold calls to dentist's offices, appointment setting, or handling special accounts for national brands—I am definitely not your average consultant.</p>
                    
                    <p>But who wants average?</p>
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top:20px; border-left: 2px solid #ffcc00; padding-left: 15px;">
                        "The proof is in the pudding. I am both the chaos of The Ninth Wave—and the force that will get you to the other side."
